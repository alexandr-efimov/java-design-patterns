# Introduction

Background story of project inspiration, patterns description from the GOF book - `each pattern describes a problem 
which occurs over and
over again in our environment, and then describes the core of the solution to that
problem, in such a way that you can use this solution a million times over, without ever
doing it the same way twice`. 

So, there are a lot of general architecture challenges/issues/problems and each of them has best solution. Purpose of
 that project is to provide complex and complete information for best solution of any problem (if it is possible of 
 course).

# TODO 

TBD - complexity of each pattern

TBD - template for doc of each pattern

TBD - pattern level, like low level for small code parts and whole approaches for project design
