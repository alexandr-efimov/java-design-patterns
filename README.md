# Introduction

Idea, patterns description - `each pattern describes a problem 
which occurs over and
over again in our environment, and then describes the core of the solution to that
problem, in such a way that you can use this solution a million times over, without ever
doing it the same way twice`. 

There are a lot of general architecture challenges/issues/problems and each of them has its best solution. Purpose of
 that project is to provide information how to implement each pattern for solving such problems, with their description.

# TODO 

TBD - add patterns except ones from GOF.
