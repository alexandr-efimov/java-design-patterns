Composite

## Category
Structural

## Intent & Motivation
Composite pattern is used where we need to treat a group of objects in similar way as a single object. Composite 
pattern composes objects in term of a tree structure to represent part as well as whole hierarchy. 
 
## Applicability
When:
- you want to represent part-whole hierarchies of objects
- you want clients to be able to ignore the difference between compositions of objects and individual objects. 
Clients will treat all objects in the composite structure uniformly
