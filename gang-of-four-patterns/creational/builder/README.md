Builder

## Category
Creational

## Intent & Motivation
Builder pattern builds a complex object using simple objects and using a step by step approach 

## Applicability
When:
- the algorithm for creating a complex object should be independent of the parts that make up the object and how 
they're assembled
- the construction process must allow different representations for the object that's constructed
