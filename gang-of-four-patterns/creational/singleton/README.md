Singleton

## Category
Creational

## Intent & Motivation
Class has only one instance

## Applicability
When:
- there must be exactly one instance of a class, and it must be accessible to clients from a well-known access point
- when the sole instance should be extensible by subclassing, and clients should be able to use an extended instance 
without modifying their code
