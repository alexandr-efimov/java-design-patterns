Interpreter

## Category
Behavioral

## Intent & Motivation
Given a language, define a representation for its grammar along with an interpreter that uses the representation to 
interpret sentences in the language.

## Applicability
Use pattern when
- there is a language to interpret, and you can represent statements in the language as abstract syntax trees
- the grammar is simple. For complex grammars, the class hierarchy for the grammar becomes large and unmanageable. 
Tools such as parser generators are a better alternative in such cases. They can interpret expressions without 
building abstract syntax trees, which can save space and possibly time
- efficiency is not a critical concern. The most efficient interpreters are usually not implemented by interpreting 
parse trees directly but by first translating them into another form. For example, regular expressions are often 
transformed into state machines. But even then, the translator can be implemented by the Interpreter pattern, so the 
pattern is still applicable
