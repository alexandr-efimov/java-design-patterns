## Intent & Motivation
Without violating encapsulation, capture and externalize an object's internal state so that the object can be 
restored to this state later.

## Applicability
Use pattern when
- a snapshot of an object's state must be saved so that it can be restored to that state later
- a direct interface to obtaining the state would expose implementation details and break the object's encapsulation
